This is the translation of MetaPost version 1.004 user's manual to 
Russian language.

It may be distributed and/or modified under the the same conditions 
as the original MetaPost manual. These conditions are specified at 
the end of `mpman-ru.tex' file.

You have to use MetaPost version 1.000 or newer to compile pictures.

If you want to use LH (CM-Super) fonts (this increases size of pdf 
upto 30%) then you should set `fontenc' option to `T2A' instead of 
'LCYW'. The default fonts are virtual Type 1 CM Cyrillic fonts from 
the standard `tetex' (and others) distributions. 

You may take LCYW package at CTAN or http://litwr.narod.ru/tex.html

Absence of the `cmap-cyr-vf' package produces lack of Unicode mapping 
for Russian labels in the MetaPost pictures.

Index and bookmarks are produced by scripts for `awk' program. Index 
is sorted by `sort' program which is depend on the locale settings.

The directory contains:
    bm-to-utf16be.awk
    ctabbing.sty
    extract-bm.awk
    idx1.awk
    idx2.awk
    idx3.awk
    Makefile

    mpman.ist
